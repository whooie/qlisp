# QLisp (temp)

A small toy lisp I wrote, heavily following [this guide][risp], whose source
code is currently also present, but will be removed.

Planned for eventual integration with my [quantum computing project][quacs].

To run the REPL (currently the only way to interact with the language) for
yourself, run
```bash
cargo run --release --bin q
```
